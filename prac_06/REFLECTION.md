Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have changed my process to commit files in regular intervals where necessary so I can roll back and change devices.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Probably starting my practicals earlier so I can receive feedback earlier.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am ensuring that I am attending the seminars and completing the practicals on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Change when I start the practical to earlier within the week.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

One request is maybe more paper exam style related questions in seminars.
