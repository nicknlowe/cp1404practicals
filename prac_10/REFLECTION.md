# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was usually very close, being around +-10 minutes in most cases.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I found myself being a lot more confident with my estimates as the course progressed, being able to estimate shorter
times and still being within that time frame thus the accuracy didn't necessarily increase or decrease.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I have learned that if I do really intend of finishing something within a set timeframe that I am actually able to
achieve it.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I found myself being able to view my work from an alternative perspective, eyeing whatever small improvements could 
make a significant difference to the readability of my code (e.g. adding what instance variables reference to in a
docstring).

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I've learned that a lot of people don't check their code often enough, leading to silly errors or just a flat out
incorrect solution.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/LimDongXian/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

I believe that my code review was short but succinct and also provided encouraging feedback whilst still conveying what
the student has to fix.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review 2](https://github.com/Tan-ming-kai/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I pinpointed the exact lines to where I believed there was an issue and stated how I believed the student should deal 
with the problem.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I honestly think the practicals are fine.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

For every week except one (I think), I was able to submit fully working and tested solutions to the required tasks.
